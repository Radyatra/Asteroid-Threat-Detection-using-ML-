# Asteroid-Threat-Detection-using-ML-
Project on a Supervised Machine Learning model used to classify Near Earth Objects (Asteroids) as a Threat or No Threat.
Threat here is defined as whether or not these objects would potentially collide with planet Earth.
This notebook includes the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, and Modelling of the dataset.

Models used includes:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Where hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation is done to the best base model (from training using default hyperparameters).

Dataset obtained for Kaggle.

A model deployment using Heroku is also included in this project.
